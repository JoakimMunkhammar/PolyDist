# polyDfit returns non-normalized polynomial coefficients for polynomial
#   density distribution approximation for the data set in vector x 
#   within limits [a,b]. (The function is similar in design to e.g. weib 
#   for Weibull parameter fit in Scipy)
#
#   Note that NumPy and SciPy has to be imported for this to work properly.
#
#   The function is based on a method of moments approach for generating 
#   polynomial probability density distribution approximations, which should
#   be referenced as:
#
#   [1] Munkhammar J, Mattsson L, RydÃ©n J (2017). Polynomial probability 
#   distribution estimation using the method of moments. PLoS ONE 
#   12(4): e0174573. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0174573
#
#   The output coefficients should be normalized by dividing them by 
#   the integral of the polynomial between a and b.
#   
#   N is the polynomial degree, and a,b are free parameters inherent to the
#   method. These typically represent endpoints of the distribution interval 
#   in consideration, since this distribution approximation routine will 
#   approximate a probability density distribution on the interval [a,b].
#
#   Too high polynomial order can cause the matrix inversion to become
#   close to singular, if so, use lower order.
#
#   For best results the polynomial approximation probability distributions 
#   should be tested for goodness-of-fit prior to use, e.g. by visual 
#   inspection, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, AIC or similar.
